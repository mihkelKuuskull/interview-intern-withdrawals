# WITHDRAWAL REPORT

BIG BOSS MAN just came to us with a request. They want to know which of our employees process the most withdrawals requested by our customers. One of your coworkers has already provided you the list of our employees and all the withdrawals. Now it's your turn to figure out how to transform this according to the BIG BOSS MAN's needs.  

Your coworker has already set up the project, you can check `package.json` for available commands to run with `npm run <script-name>`.  
To setup the project, please make sure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.dev/) installed, then run `npm install` && `npm run build`
